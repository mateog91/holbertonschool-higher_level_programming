"""
This module has one function: ''matrix_dived'' divides all elements of a matrix.

Description:
- matrix must be a list of lists of integers or floats, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats
- Each row of the matrix must be of the same size, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message Each row of the matrix must have the same size
- div must be a number (integer or float), otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message div must be a number
- div canâ€™t be equal to 0, otherwise raise a ZeroDivisionError exception with the message division by zero
- All elements of the matrix should be divided by div, rounded to 2 decimal places
